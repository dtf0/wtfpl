# WTFPL
Supposedly not a `copyleft` licence [0], but it's certainly the most libre in
my book.

See *[rWTFPL](https://ph.dtf.wtf/source/wtfpl/)* for the maintained repo.

Well, thanks to you, [@theiostream](https://github.com/theiostream/theiostream.github.com), I've decided to go with the slightly modified WTFPLv3.1...

## Version 3.1
- Change instances of *`license`* -> **`licence`**

My recommendation is to just do what the fuck you want to. Copy it, change 'em
back to `license`, increase the version number, convert spaces to tabs,
whatever dude.
